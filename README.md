# Online Attendance Management System

## Introduction
Online Attendance Management System is an innovative tool to maintain and manage the attendance of students/teachers.. This project helps to ease the process of maintaining student and faculty attendance in paper.
The following are the users of the system: Admin, Teacher and Student. 
The Admin-user is a super-user who has the rights to create and update the accounts of teachers as well as students. He updates the records of the database that stores information about the students, teachers and courses to be studied.
If the user is a teacher, he can mark and monitor each student's attendance for his lectures. Also, teachers can directly check their attendance status on their accounts.
If the user is a student, he must first register himself for the courses he is interested to attend. Then he will be able to check his attendance status for each of his registered course to ensure that he is regular to all his classes.
This Online Attendance Management system provides transparency as it can be used anywhere, anytime. This system can be used effectively both in schools and universities.
